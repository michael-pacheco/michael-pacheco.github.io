          <p style="">As a data analyst, a good portion of my work deals with creating charts and graphs so that our users can visualize the data we want to bring to their attention. Visualizations almost always makes it easier for people to interpret data - and it also looks pretty!</p>
          <p>One of the leading frameworks for graph generation is <a target="_blank" href="https://plot.ly/">Plotly</a>. The framework is compatible with a few languages, including Python, JS, R and Matlab. We are going to be using the Javascript version - we could also use the Python one, but the Javascript method is much simpler (the Python method includes manually serving dynamically generated images ideally stored in buffers in the back end).</p>
          <p>We are also going to build a website that will display the visualization to our users. To accomplish this, I chose <a target="_blank" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>.</p>
          <p>
            First let's start off by getting all we need:
          </p>
          <ol>
          <li>
            <ultext><a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> 3.2+</ultext> (or less, but be prepared to change things to their Python 3x equivalent)
            <p>&#8226; Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python download page </a> and press the big yellow download (make sure to click the "Download Python 3.x.x" one!) </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <ultext>Pip</ultext>
            <p>&#8226; <a target="_blank" href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py">Download get-pip.py</a></p>
            <p>&#8226; In your terminal, run it using the command: <custompre class="custom">python3 get-pip.py</custompre></p>
          </li>
          <br>
            <li>
              <ultext>Flask</ultext>
              <p>&#8226; In your terminal, run the command: <custompre class="custom">pip3 install Flask</custompre> <p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br><br>
          <p>
            Aaaand that's it. Now we get to the fun part!
          </p>
          <p>
            First off, let's get comfortable with Flask by getting it up and running. Create a file called flaskapp.py with the following contents:
          </p>
          <div>
            {{ default_flask|safe }}
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <p>
            To get this baby up and running, run the command: <custompre>python3 flaskapp.py</custompre> (make sure you are in the same directory as the file!). <br>Your console should show the following message:
          </p>
            <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='blog/flask-plotly-overtime/pic2.jpg')}}">
            <br><br>
          <p>
            Now open your browser and access that address! (<a target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:5000">http://127.0.0.1:5000</a>)
            We should now see the timeless sentence that we have all come to know and love:
          </p>
          <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='blog/flask-plotly-overtime/pic3.jpg')}}"><br><br>
          <p>
            So, through this console and running the file, our Flask server is running on the IP address 127.0.0.1 and on port 5000. If desired, the IP and port numbers can be changed by editing line 10 in the file flaskapp.py above. For example, to change the Flask server to run on the IP 0.0.0.0 and port 1337, make the following change:
          </p>
          <custompre style="text-align: center; margin:0 auto;">app.run(host="0.0.0.0",port=1337, threaded=True)</custompre>
          <br><br><br>
          <p>
            At this moment, all we are doing is returning text on our website. Abiding to the conventions made for us by our predecessors, we should actually be serving an HTML file containing everything we want to show our user. Because we all want to be accepted in life, let's make a file called index.html with the following code:
          </p>
          <br>
          {{ index1|safe }}
          <br>
          <p>
            In the same folder as your flaskapp.py file, create a folder called "templates" and place the index.html file in there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, we have to change the code in flaskapp.py to serve this HTML file.
             All we have to do is now return the HTML file instead of text, which we can do with the help of one of Flask's functions:
              render_template. This function will search for the file we specify in the templates folder located in the same directory as the Flask application:
          </p>
          <br>
          {{ default_flask2|safe }}
          <br>
          <p>
            Congratulations! If you've come this far, you're now a Web Developer! <span style="font-size:50%">But don't tell all your friends just yet. We can show off once we're done the tutorial.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Here comes the graphing part - the moment we've been dreading. The thing is, Plotly makes our lives easy and enjoyable - even in JS!
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, to create a graph we need some data.
            I've extracted some data from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians">/r/askhistorians</a>
             from all posts made in 2016 and saved it to a CSV file. You can do this do using a website that I made here:
             <a target="_blank" href="http://collector.socialmediadata.org/"> (shameless plug) </a>. If you'd like to look at the contents of the file, you can do so at this project's link at github  <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/michael-pacheco/flask-plotly-overtime">here</a> (note: I had to remove many columns as the file was too large for GitHub!).
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the CSV file, we're going to make a graph showing the number of posts over time on /r/askhistorians.
            To do this, we need the date every post in our file was made one, and the frequencies of posts made on those specific dates.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to store our data in a dictionary, where the keys will be a string of the date, and the value will be the frequency of posts made on that date.
            Next, we want to populate this dictionary by iterating through each row of the CSV file and extracting the column "date" from each of those rows.
          </p>
          <br>
          {{ flask1|safe }}
          <br>
          <p>
            The reader variable lets us refer to columns in the rows like a dictionary, which is preferable to indexing.
            If the row has a column date, we want to set a variable to hold the string of the date and then convert that variable to a date time object.
            We then check if that object is in our dictionary - if it is, we increment its frequency by one. If it isn't, we set its frequency to one instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we are doing some formatting of our dictionary. We want our graph to display the dates oldest to newest, so we need to do some sorting.
          </p>
          <br>
          {{ flask2|safe }}
          <br>
          <p>
            Finally, we will put our data in JSON format to be accepted easily by Plotly. We are also converting our date times back to strings (there are different date time objects in JS, so we want strings here), and also changing the format to be full month name, date and year. The format of date time objects can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html">here</a>. We also want to pass our data to the front end - we do so by giving render_template a second parameter that is our data.
            Here is the end result of the code:
          </p>
          <br>
          {{flask3|safe}}
          <p>Don't get off your high horse just yet. We still need to edit our index.html to show the visualization!</p>
          <p>
            To create the graph using plotly, we need to import the plotly-latest-min.js file. We then create a div with the id "graph" to give to Plotly later. We need to retrieve our data from the back end into the front end, which is easy with Flask and Jinja2 templates:
          </p>
          {{ index2|safe }}
          <p>
            This sets the front end JS variable data to the data we computed in the backend! Easy as pie.
            The function for the creation of the graph takes two parameters: the name of the div or element that you wish to have the graph in, and the data.
          </p>
          <p>
            And we are done! Rerun the Flask server and visit <a target="_blank" href="http://127.0.0.1:5000">127.0.0.1:5000</a>, and you should see the interactive Plotly graph just like the one at the top of this page!
          </p>
