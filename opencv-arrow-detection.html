                  <p>
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> is an amazing library that focuses on computer vision - the interpretation of images through a computer.
                     This is a shiny new toy for many, as it can be used for many cool projects - including all the recent self-driving hype.
                     <p>I myself am not too familiar with OpenCV as of yet, as I've mostly been focused on front-end and back-end web development. Of course, this does not mean I can't dabble in interesting libraries! <custom style="font-size: 50%">It just means I have very little time to do so, unfortunately.</custom>
                   </p>

                   <p>Before watching any tutorials on OpenCV, and even before taking any computer vision classes (which I have already enrolled in for this upcoming winter semester), I decided to take a crack at arrow orientation and recognition. One of the cool things about OpenCV <custom style="font-size: 50%">and maybe one of the disturbing things</custom> is that there are so many ways to do similar things, much of which I haven't even discovered yet!
                   </p>

                   <p>
                     With my idea in mind, all I had to do was find out a way to do it. My original thought was that arrows are just shapes - an area closed off by a border.
                    The border, or perimeter of the shape, is made up with lines. If the arrow is the same size (meaning I used the same picture of an arrow),
                     it would also have the same angles. If I could determine all the lines on the image, and then determine the angle they are drawn at according to some consistent origin, I could determine the orientation!
                   </p>
                   <p>The next step was going to Google to find something in the OpenCV documentation that could help me achieve this, where I discovered the function for <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/imgproc/doc/feature_detection.html?highlight=houghlines#houghlines">HoughLines</a>.
                     The description of this function is: "Finds lines in a binary image using the standard Hough transform". Unfamiliar with "the standard Hough transform", I took to Google once again. I found this <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/hough.htm">website</a> that gives an amazing explanation.
                     Luckily, OpenCV has a tutorial section as well, where I found <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_houghlines/py_houghlines.html">this page showing how to use the function and what it does</a>.
                   </p>
                   <p>The next step was figuring out what the code above did. All it does is applies a Canny Edge Detection function, then the Hough Lines function, and draws the lines that are returned by Hough Lines! Sounds easy enough <custom style="font-size: 50%">mainly because we aren't the ones figuring out how to actually implement these functions!</custom>.
                   </p>

                   <p>The lines returned by the Hough Lines function come with rho and theta values, which can tell you the orientation of the line. Huzzah. All I did from there was put my arrow image in the code, applied the Canny and Hough Lines functions to it, and printed out every rho and theta value for each line.</p>
                   <p>By looking at the values printed out by the program when it draws the lines on the head of the arrow, I could tell the specific range of rho and theta values that those lines would have if the arrow was pointing in each particular direction. From there, if we find these particular lines returned by the Hough Lines function that are within these ranges, we can determine the orientation.
                   </p>
                   <p>Here is the code that I wrote for the arrow detection:</p>

                   {{arrow_detection|safe}}

                  <p>As you can see in the if statements, we are actually just checking the rho and theta values - if they are within the range, we increment an array of size 2, where each index corresponds to each of the lines that we are looking for. If both values in the array are greater than 0, then that array is the orientation of the arrow.
                  </p>
                  <p>As I mentioned earlier, this will only work with an arrow of the same proportions in different orientations. If we tried this program on another arrow where the lines we're analyzing have theta values that are higher or lower, it would not give the correct answer.</p>
                  <p>Here is a demonstration of the program. I used this simple image of an arrow and rotated it to get the other orientations (up, down and right):</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Here is the output of the program on each of the arrows:</p><br>
                  <img style="width:50%" src="/static/blog/opencv-arrow-detection/demo1.jpg">
                  <img style="width:50%" src="/static/blog/opencv-arrow-detection/demo2.jpg">
                  <img style="width:50%" src="/static/blog/opencv-arrow-detection/demo3.jpg">
                  <img style="width:50%" src="/static/blog/opencv-arrow-detection/demo4.jpg">
                  <br>
                  <p>Aaaand it works! Although I definitely do not think this is a good solution. This approach consists of trial and error to find each of the lines you're looking for, and then make condition statements for them.
                    An ideal solution would be to have something that could be generalized to work on all arrows - no matter what angles the arrow's lines are drawn at.
                    In a practical example where a robot is trying to identify the orientation of an arrow through a camera, this implementation also heavily depends on the angle the camera is viewing the arrow.
                    If the angle the camera is capturing the arrow is not consistent, this implementation will also have several issues determining the orientation, as the rho and theta values will change as a result.
                    So an even better solution would be one that is able to extract the orientation, regardless of how the arrow is drawn, and regardless of the camera's angle while looking at the arrow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Regardless, I'll use this as stepping stone for learning computer vision, as I'll definitely be looking for a better solution in the near future!</p>
