                <p> As more time goes on, it seems more and more Computer Science graduates are doing projects involving self-driving cars. These projects seem extremely exciting to do, so I finally decided to jump on the bandwagon.
                <br>
                I've always wanted to make a bot play some of the games I've played in the past that involve driving, but I wanted to pick one that was a little different than the others.
                </p>

                <p>Enter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Taxi">Crazy Taxi!</a> - a game where abiding to the rules of driving does not really matter.

                <p>
                  Here is a screenshot of the game after picking up a customer:
                  </p>

                  <img src="/static/blog/crazy-taxi-1/1.PNG">
                  <br>
                <p>
                As you can see, there is a huge green arrow at the top of the screen. This tells us where our customer's destination is - sort of like using GPS! Therefore step one of this project is to interpret this arrow!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Naturally, we need to somehow take a video of the game we're playing using OpenCV. Luckily, a great project to start off from was <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/hough-lines-python-plays-gta-v/?completed=/lane-region-of-interest-python-plays-gta-v/">PythonProgamming.net's "OpenCV plays GTA V"</a>.
                  This helped me with a lot of the tasks including capturing the game, selection a region of interest (the area that is the arrow) and DirectInputs - so big shoutouts to the authors!
                </p>

                {{breakdown1|safe}}

                <p>
                 The function roi helps us select a "Region of Interest". When we apply HoughLines, we want the function to be focused on the region of the arrow, so when the function returns the array of lines we can be sure that these lines all correspond to the arrow and nothign else.
                 <br>
                 Next, the function process_img processes our image however we want. I set it to process the image by looking for green objects by defining lower and upper values for green that the arrow has.
                 Then, send it to our roi function so that we have only the region of the arrow!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Finally, our main function "captures video", by taking a screen-shotting function (ImageGrab) and shoving it in a while loop.
                    The keyword argument "bbox" represents the area of the bounding box we want to take a picture of (x,y,x2,y2). I set this to be as big as the window running the game.
                     We then process the screen shot as we defined earlier, and show it (along with some benchmarking outputs to console to see how long it took to capture the image).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Running the program with the game running, we get this image:
                  </p>
                  <img src="/static/blog/crazy-taxi-1/2.PNG">
                <br>

                <p>
                  Exactly what we want! Now we move onto applying Hough Transform by using the HoughLines function:
                </p>
                {{breakdown2|safe}}

                <p>
                  The next step was do figure out which lines (including their slope and length) correspond to the rotations of the arrow.
                   I did this by printing out the x1,x2,y1,y2 coordinates of the lines, and also printing the calculations done for slope and length.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, we need to get the program to perform inputs using (specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectInput">DirectInput</a> as we need to map inputs to work inside of a game).
                  Based on the rotation of the arrow, we want it to be able to drive in that direction! Keep in mind - all of this ends up being directly related to the button configuration set in the game. If the arrow is pointing left, we will drive forward and left. If it is pointing right, we will drive forward and right!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I took a video showcasing the current state of the program. Keep in mind the arrow only appears after picking up a customer (which will be done in the future), meaning I drove the car at the beginning to pick up the first customer, but the program takes the wheel from there!
                </p>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJbIfC7JVGw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <br><br><br>
                <p>
                  There is still a big problem - the program cannot tell when the arrow is pointing forwards or backwards. If the arrow starts to point behind the car, it will just drive forwards. In the video you can see this happen after the program picks up a second customer by fluke, and soft locks itself by driving into a wall, as it cannot reverse.
                  At that moment the console still outputs "forward", even though the arrow is pointing straight behind the car. Fixing this error is next on the list!
                  Also keep in mind I am not looking out for buildings yet, as the arrow is actually pretty descriptive of where we have to go to drop off our customer. There are instances however where the arrow will point into a building, but this doesn't happen very often.
                </p>
